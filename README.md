## Nomad - Mars rovers
That's my first experiment with Vue.js. Kinda like it ;)

If you like astronomy, this is a little integration with NASA's api.
You can select one of three rovers that are in Mars (Curiosity, Spirit and Opportunity)
and select one of his cameras to get photos from there.

you can access the app by the following link:

Hope you like it.
